Navie Bayes:Na√Øve Bayes is one of the fast and easy ML algorithms to predict a class of datasets. It can be used for Binary as well as Multi-class Classifications.



Navie Bayes are three type:
  1)Gaussian Naive Bayes
  2)Multinomial Navie bayes
  3)Bernoulli Naivie bayes
  


Gaussian Navie bayes:

                  supervised machine learning classification algorithms based on the Bayes theorem.
                  Gaussian Navie Bayes follows Gaussian normal distribution and supports continuous data
                  
                  
                  
                  
Multinomial Naive Bayes:

                   suitable for classification with discrete features .it is used in text type output like spam mail detection
                   
                   
                   
Bernoulli Naive Bayes:

                   This is used for discrete data and it works on Bernoulli distribution. The main feature of Bernoulli Naive Bayes is that it accepts features only as binary values 
                   like true or false,yes or no, success or failure, 0 or 1 and so on. So when the feature values are binarywe know that we have to use Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier.
